# Improved_Cr_fill

## Train

1. If you want to train from scratch , you need to remove checkpoints, create flist.py of paths to images used to train which will be more detail in [edge-connect ](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect) and create config.py of hyper-parameters as in generative_inpaintingv2/contextual_loss_fix_mask_wise_and_pixel_shuffle/checkpoint/checkpoint_change_dis or reuse config.py  if you can to continue the training

2.You can also check my [flist.py](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IuoeYJKbhN0M-RnhDhzfwX2JqOcqILm2?usp=sharing) if you want

3.The file for training is **contextual_loss_fix_mask_wise_and_pixel_shuffle_change_dis.ipynb**
